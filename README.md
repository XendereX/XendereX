## Welcome. 
<p>Name’s XendereX.</p>

This place exists simply because I needed somewhere to collect what I’ve done, what I’ve learned, and what I’m still trying to figure out.

I spend most of my time navigating the digital world — not just using it, but paying attention to how it works behind the surface. Over time, I started noticing how little control we actually have.

Privacy is disappearing. Everything we do is monitored in some way, and most people either don’t know, or don’t care. That’s the part that bothers me the most.

I don’t have a big mission. I’m not building anything for fame, and I’m not pretending to be someone I’m not. I’m just moving through this system like everyone else — trying to keep my eyes open, trying not to lose myself in the process.

I’ve made things. I’ve broken things. I’ve learned from both.

What’s here is the result of all that — some projects, some thoughts, a few tools, and whatever else I think is worth leaving behind.

Nothing here is polished for show. It’s just real. And that’s enough for me.

If any of this resonates with you — then maybe you're one of the few still paying attention.
